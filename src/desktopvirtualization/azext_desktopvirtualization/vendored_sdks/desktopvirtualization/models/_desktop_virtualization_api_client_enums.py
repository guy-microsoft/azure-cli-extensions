    can succeed if the SessionHost is not joined to the domain. DomainTrustCheck - Verifies the
    SessionHost is not experiencing domain trust issues that will prevent authentication on
    SessionHost at connection time when session is created. If this check fails is classified as
    fatal as no connection can succeed if we cannot reach the domain for authentication on the
    SessionHost. FSLogixHealthCheck - Verifies the FSLogix service is up and running to make sure
    users' profiles are loaded in the session. If this check fails is classified as fatal as even
    if the connection can succeed, user experience is bad as the user profile cannot be loaded and
    user will get a temporary profile in the session. SxSStackListenerCheck - Verifies that the SxS
    stack is up and running so connections can succeed. If this check fails is classified as fatal
    as no connection can succeed if the SxS stack is not ready. UrlsAccessibleCheck - Verifies that
    the required WVD service and Geneva URLs are reachable from the SessionHost. These URLs are:
    RdTokenUri, RdBrokerURI, RdDiagnosticsUri and storage blob URLs for agent monitoring (geneva).
    If this check fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue
    may be that monitoring agent is unable to store warm path data (logs, operations ...).
    MonitoringAgentCheck - Verifies that the required Geneva agent is running. If this check fails,
    it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue may be that
    monitoring agent is missing or running (possibly) older version. DomainReachable - Verifies the
    domain the SessionHost is joined to is still reachable. If this check fails is classified as
    fatal as no connection can succeed if the domain the SessionHost is joined is not reachable at
    the time of connection. WebRTCRedirectorCheck - Verifies whether the WebRTCRedirector component
    is healthy. The WebRTCRedirector component is used to optimize video and audio performance in
    Microsoft Teams. This checks whether the component is still running, and whether there is a
    higher version available. If this check fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can
    service connections, main issue may be the WebRTCRedirector component has to be restarted or
    updated. SupportedEncryptionCheck - Verifies the value of SecurityLayer registration key. If
    the value is 0 (SecurityLayer.RDP) this check fails with Error code =
    NativeMethodErrorCode.E_FAIL and is fatal. If the value is 1 (SecurityLayer.Negotiate) this
    check fails with Error code = NativeMethodErrorCode.ERROR_SUCCESS and is non fatal.
    MetaDataServiceCheck - Verifies the metadata service is accessible and return compute
    properties. AppAttachHealthCheck - Verifies that the AppAttachService is healthy (there were no
    issues during package staging). The AppAttachService is used to enable the staging/registration
    (and eventual deregistration/destaging) of MSIX apps that have been set up by the tenant admin.
    This checks whether the component had any failures during package staging. Failures in staging
    will prevent some MSIX apps from working properly for the end user. If this check fails, it is
    non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue may be certain apps will
    not work for end-users.
